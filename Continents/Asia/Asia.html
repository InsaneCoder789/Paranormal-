<p>   which We as a Team Think that we should look</center><p><br>



<p>A trip to Asia is a far-flung event with ancient temples, diverse cuisines, and colorful traditions. But there’s also a darker side to experience, one with tales of ghosts and creepy things that go bump in the night.</p>

<p> From a former war prison with a rumored roaming resident to a haunted fort in India where you are forbidden to go at night, there are plenty of places in Asia to go searching for the eerie.</p>
    
<p>Next time you’re in Beijing, take a second look at the Forbidden City, an unbelievably popular tourist attraction that is typically closed — to the living, at least — at night, or head to some</p> 
<p>of these other spots (at your own risk). Because along with Asia’s rich history is a more sinister past that, if you ask some people, is still alive and well today.</p>
    
<p>These are some of Asia’s most haunted spots. Are you brave enough to add them to your next itinerary?,</p><br>

                                      <h3><center>Bhangarh Fort, India</center></h3>
<p> This impressive 17th century fort, located in Rajasthan, India, was once home to royalty, but now it is one of the most haunted places in the country.</p>
<p>Bhangarh Fort was built in 1631, complete with temples and a palace, before it was suddenly and mysteriously abandoned. There are several stories used to explain why people left this once-great fort.</p>
<p> One legend says that someone placed a curse upon the fort because it was casting a shadow over their home, and another attributes its ruin to a love potion gone wrong. Whatever the cause, visitors are</p>
<p> no longer allowed in after dark, but you can visit during daylight hours — if you dare.</p>
